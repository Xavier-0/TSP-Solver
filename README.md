# TSP-solver
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most widely studied problems in combinatorial optimization. Given a collection of cities and the cost of travel between each pair of them, the traveling salesman problem is to find the cheapest way of visiting all of the cities and returning to the starting point. 

various methods to solve TSP problem:
1. **greedy algorithm**
2. **genetic algorithm**
